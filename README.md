# Founder-Investor Matchmaker  

This project is a Python-based solution for matching founders with investors based on industry preferences and funding requirements. By using data preprocessing, normalization, and cosine similarity, the program calculates match scores between founders and investors, helping both parties find the best fit for collaboration.  

---

## **Features**  
- Handles missing data using imputation techniques for categorical and numerical columns.  
- One-hot encoding for industry fields and Min-Max scaling for funding data.  
- Calculates weighted similarity scores based on industry and funding requirements.  
- Visualizes match scores using a heatmap for better insights.

## **Installation**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/founder-investor-matchmaker.git
   cd founder-investor-matchmaker
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```  

---

## **Usage**  

1. Prepare your data as Pandas DataFrames for founders and investors.  
2. Instantiate the `FounderInvestorMatcher` class.  
3. Use the `compute_match_scores` method to calculate match scores.  
4. Visualize the results using the heatmap.  

```python
from matcher import FounderInvestorMatcher
import pandas as pd

founders = pd.DataFrame({
    'industry': ['Tech', 'Health', None],
    'stage': ['Seed', 'Series A', 'Pre-Seed'],
    'funding_required': [500000, 2000000, None]
})

investors = pd.DataFrame({
    'preferred_industry': ['Tech', 'Health', None],
    'investment_stage': ['Seed', 'Series B', 'Series A'],
    'investment_min': [100000, 500000, 100000],
    'investment_max': [1000000, 3000000, None]
})

matcher = FounderInvestorMatcher()
match_scores = matcher.compute_match_scores(founders, investors)
print(match_scores)
```  

---

## **Visualization**  

The program includes a built-in heatmap visualization to display match scores:  

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(match_scores, annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu", cbar=True, fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Founder-Investor Match Scores")
plt.show()
```

## **Project Structure**  

- **`matcher.py`**: Contains the `FounderInvestorMatcher` class with all core logic.  
- **`data/`**: Folder to store input data for founders and investors.  
- **`visualizations/`**: Stores heatmap outputs (optional).
